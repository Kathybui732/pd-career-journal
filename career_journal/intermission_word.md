Good morning!

Thank you so much again for setting up the job shadow with Marc. I really appreciated everything you did and for answering all my questions. I'm going ot graduate during this upcoming November and would really appreciate if you kept me in mind for any junior job openings. I really enjoyed working with you both and would love to be considered for your team at JumpCloud. Please let me know if anything comes up!


Hello,

I recently saw that you were back in Colorado and would love to get a chance to pick your brain! I'm going to graduate in November and would love to hear about your experience throughout the years. If you have a chance to meet up over zoom or in person for coffee and a chat, I would really appreciate it!
