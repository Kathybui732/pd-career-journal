### Mod 3 Week 3: Outreach & Networking II <a name="week-3"></a>

1. Back to your resume and cover letter you've been working on:
* What other next steps do you want to take to make these two components stronger?

2. Outreach Brainstorming:
* Either explore the company you wrote a cover letter for or find a new company to explore this week; Go to their company LinkedIn page and start to explore the employees. Who are a couple people you could reach out to? Why?

3. Finalize Your Plan:  
* Who have you decided to reach out to? Why that person? How will you contact them? What do you want to talk to them about? How will you follow up?

4. Execute your plan:
* Reach out to your contact THIS WEEK. If possible, reach out to more than one person OR find a meetup to attend also. What happened? What did you learn about the company? What other next steps should you take for pursuing this company? Be sure to update this in Huntr.
