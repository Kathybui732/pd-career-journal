### Mod 3 Week 3: Outreach & Networking II <a name="week-3"></a>

1. Back to your resume and cover letter you've been working on:
* What other next steps do you want to take to make these two components stronger?
I need to customize my resumes more curate towards the individual companies. The few companies I have looked into range from hotels to finance, so personalizing those to a company should happen just to make it look like I applied personally to that company.

2. Outreach Brainstorming:
* Either explore the company you wrote a cover letter for or find a new company to explore this week; Go to their company LinkedIn page and start to explore the employees. Who are a couple people you could reach out to? Why?
I have done some research on Hotel Engine, found their VP of engineering. I was going to try to reach out to him.

3. Finalize Your Plan:  
* Who have you decided to reach out to? Why that person? How will you contact them? What do you want to talk to them about? How will you follow up?
I just reached out to all these people just to inquire about their positions and asked them to keep an eye out for job openings for me. I let them know what I was doing and my intentions and that I will be graduating in November. And asked if they would keep me in mind if they see anything. I plan on following up with them every 2 weeks over the next 3 months. Hotel engine has a job posting and Joylabs is currently hiring, so, I have been personalizing my resume and cover letter to fit those positions.

4. Execute your plan:
* Reach out to your contact THIS WEEK. If possible, reach out to more than one person OR find a meetup to attend also. What happened? What did you learn about the company? What other next steps should you take for pursuing this company? Be sure to update this in Huntr.
