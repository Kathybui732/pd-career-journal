### Mod 3 Week 2: The Application Process  <a name="week-2"></a>

1. Find a position or use a position you've put on your Huntr board and write a cover letter for that position in a Google doc or gist. Reference these [cover letter resources](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum-site/blob/master/resources/cover_letter_resources.md) as well as [the session](https://careerdev.turing.io/module_three/week_2_application_process) to complete your cover letter.
* Post the link to your cover letter here

2. Review your cover letter with a peer some time this week. What feedback did your partner give you? What next steps will you take to make your cover letter even stronger?
My partner said that I needed to talk more about myself and how I would be a good fit for the company rather than just praising the company itself. I talked about the projects, but, I could also explain how my past work experience would be a fit for their company.

3. If you were to apply to this position (and you should!), how will you customize your resume for it? What other next steps would you need to take here?
This company for the most part uses the same language, framework and tools that turing has given me, so, it's a nice easy for application to make. However, I understand that others may not be like this. So, I'm going to need to customize my resume to make me a better cnadidate for those postions.
