### Mod 3 Week 2: The Application Process  <a name="week-2"></a>

1. Find a position or use a position you've put on your Huntr board and write a cover letter for that position in a Google doc or gist. Reference these [cover letter resources](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum-site/blob/master/resources/cover_letter_resources.md) as well as [the session](https://careerdev.turing.io/module_three/week_2_application_process) to complete your cover letter.
* Post the link to your cover letter here

2. Review your cover letter with a peer some time this week. What feedback did your partner give you? What next steps will you take to make your cover letter even stronger?

3. If you were to apply to this position (and you should!), how will you customize your resume for it? What other next steps would you need to take here?
