### Mod 3 Week 4: Interview Prep  <a name="week-4"></a>

1. Prepare for Job Shadow: AEIOU
* Activities: what questions do you have about the activities that a software developer does on a daily basis?
  - I don't really have too many questions about activities. I already have a lot of activities I enjoy whether or not I am a software developer.
* Environment: what questions do you have about the overall environment and culture of this workplace?
  - Would you say that there is a bro culture here?
  - How relaxed is the dress code?
  - What is your favorite part about this company?
* Interactions: what questions do you have about the team at this company? What do you hope to see in your interactions during the shadow?
* Objects: what questions do you have about the code or the product?
  - Why this language?
  - Are you open to hire someone who doesn't know the language, but is ready to learn and is a fast learner?
* Users: what questions do you have about how the company interacts with their users?
  - How often do you take in user input?
  - How often do you change or add features to your product?

2. After the Job Shadow, reflect on the same questions; what are your takeaways from the shadow?
* Activities: what was engaging to the person/people you shadowed? n/a
* Environment: what did you notice about how they talked about the culture and environment of this company?
  - Not interested in hiring juniors now, but their team hires many devs who are not well rehearsed in Go
* Interactions: what did you notice about your interactions with this person/people?
  - Very open and willing to team. Very open to new ideas and new ways to approach things. Allowed me to give my input on how I would solve the current problem at hand.
* Objects: what did you learn about their approach to code and/or product development?
  - A lot of googling when he didn't know what he was doing.
* Users: what did you learn about their approach to their users?
  - He works with the sales team often - has meetings with them once a week so that they can get input on how their product is working in conjunction with other third party apps that the client is using.
* What are your main takeaways from the shadow? How will you use this information to help you with your job search strategy?
  - I got a lot of words of wisdom about the process that he took and how people actually are in the community. They're all willing to help and ready to teach especially when you're a junior.

3. Interview Prep:
* Pick a successful project and write about it with the STAR method (What was the situation/scenario of the project? What was the task/target of the project? What action steps did you take? What were the results?):
S - Building a project that we thought was easy, but actually was really difficult
T - Building a project that emphasized the use of images
A - A lot of research allowing us to come up with many different options to approach building the project
R - We were able to deliver in a 8 day time period a product that was viable
* Write about a time you failed and what you learned from that experience:
  - not being able to follow my original vision career. I started my whole life thinking that was the only thing I wanted to do, and when I realized that was no longer possible, it was heartbreaking.
* Write about how you've approached working with a team using a specific example:
  - I think every team has a different dynamic and I always like to fill the position that the team lacks the most. In my last group project, there wasn't a clear vision, so we often kept getting off track. So, I took up that role by managing project boards and explicitly announcing the goals for the day and the hw for tonight just to give our team little goals and direction.
* What other stories will you prepare to share?
* Do some research into your top companies' tech stacks; what do you already know? What can you compare to your own learning? What do you need to learn more about?
* Using this [interview prep resource doc](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum-site/blob/master/resources/interview_prep_resources.md), pick out at least 3 resources you will use to prepare for interviews as well as 3 behavioral questions you could practice:
