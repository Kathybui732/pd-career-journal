### Mod 3 Week 5: Refining Your Strategy  <a name="week-5"></a>

1. Taking stock of where you are: what have you accomplished this module? What have you learned? Where are you stuck (have you not been able to follow through on outreach? Is your resume not finished?)? I have learned a lot about how to do cold outreaches. I have been having a hard time actually putting them into action, though. My resume is complete.

2. Create plans for 3 different companies you want to target:
* Questions to reflect on here: Why do you like this company? What makes you want to work there? Why are you a good fit for this company? What do you bring to the company? What transferable skills do you have? What do you already know about the company (product, team, culture, company size, location, etc.)? What do you need to learn?
* Steps to take:
  * Outreach: look at the companyâ€™s LinkedIn page: who could you reach out to? What questions do you want to ask that person?
  * Experience: once you've made a connection at the company, how could you find out more? Consider setting up a job shadow or exploring their tech stack in your projects
* Read back over the plan. How does it reflect your vision?
* Imagine that you get the job. A year later, what have you gained from this experience? How have you started to fulfill your vision?

* Plan #1: github - I use their product religiously now, so it would be cool to be apart of their team. Because I use their product, I think I would make a great addition because I know what it is like to be their user. 3 5 3 5

* Plan #2: Hotel engine would also be a great place to work at  especially because they do code on ruby on rails and I think my ruby skills have been polished over the course of Turing. So, I would be able to bring technical skills to them. 5 3 5 3

* Plan #3: I do not have a 3rd one at this time

3. Make it actionable: rank each plan on a scale of 1-5 for how much your plan aligns with the following:
* Available resources to help you pursue it: contacts, time, knowledge of the company, etc.
* Coherence: how it aligns with your career vision
* Confidence level: how feasible does this feel to you?
* How excited you are about it?

Now, pick the plan with the highest numbers across the board. What steps will you take next to pursue this strategy as you go into the next module?
