### Mod 1 Week 2: Understanding your values and identity
1. [Power of self-reflection](https://medium.com/publishous/the-power-of-self-reflection-c1a654ea03a)
* What is challenging about self-reflection? I haven't self reflected in a while. I also haven't self reflected since I decided to pursue a new career, so I do feel lost. I'm not too sure about what I want or where I'm going really, so, that made the self reflection a lot harder.
* How can you continue to build the habit of self-reflection at Turing? By doing it consistently and honestly. It's easy to lie to yourself and bs your way through things. But, that isn't beneficial to you. So, I just have to remind myself that I am doing this for me. So, I need to set the time and effort to do it.

2. Social identity mapping
First, create you own social identity map on a piece of paper (or [print this out](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/files/Social%20Identity%20Map.pdf)):
* Outer ring: write words that describe your given identity - Given traits - Asian+, female+, born in Denver-, middle child-, 1st gen immigrant/english as a second language+
* Middle ring: list aspects of your chosen identity - Chosen traits - health background-, Denverite?, loves snowboarding-, positive outlook+, enjoys gaming+, competitive+.
* Center: write your core attributesâ€”traits, behaviors, beliefs, values, characteristics, and skills that you think make you unique as an individual. Select things that are enduring and key to who you are - Core traits - extroverted-introvert?, driven+, resilient+, adaptable+, caring+.

After you complete your map:
* Underline the items that are important to you
* Put a + beside the items that you believe clearly demonstrate that you fit into the tech industry
* Put a - beside the items that you believe do not demonstrate that you fit into the tech industry
* Put a ? beside the items that you're unsure how they could show your ability to contribute to the tech industry

Reflect:
* What does your social identity tell you about what you already bring to the tech industry?
  For the given trait, I was given traits that are not the dominant majority, so, I feel like those traits will be beneficial to the tech industry because I bring diversity. I've experienced specific things being Asian and female that might be different from a Caucasian male, for example. My core/chosen identity also brings a lot, I would like to think. Being driven, positive, competitive, resilient, adaptable are all things I think would help me help drive my piece in the tech industry as well as try to contribute to the industry.
* What would it look like for some of your minuses or question marks to turn into pluses? In other words, how could some of these traits be assets for the tech industry? Some of my question marks were for being a Denverite, loving snowboarding/the outdoors. And I feel like, because I enjoy those things, I would be more inclined to build or develop things that haven't been there for before for those things. Or because I live in Denver, I know its niche best to be able to create something that may apply to the people here that may not work in other places.

3. Values mapping
Pull out 5 values for each bullet below from [this list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wF1afCu5KqLfDa8rLiOH9ICfIWyjWZRS5Dba7UehYMc/edit?usp=sharing):
* Always valued:
* Often valued:
* Sometimes valued:
* Seldom valued:

Reflect:
* What do these values tell you about yourself? I think these values tell me that I tend to value productivity and efficiency for my life. Although I do care a lot about how other people feel and where they are with things, I don't really give myself that. When I'm feeling down or not feeling at my best, I always try to put that aside if there is something more urgent in the foresight. I also tend to put how other's are feeling before how I'm feeling myself, because I would rather then be happy because I'm usually okay with whatever.

4. Workview & Lifeview
* Summarize what good, worthwhile work means to you (Tip: this is NOT about what work you want to do but about why work matters to you): worthwhile work is work that is stimulating and fulfilling to me. When I was at my previous job, I went through all the motions. I did the work, but I was never happy with what I was doing and it just wasn't stimulating to me. When something seems intriguing to me, I can get lost on it and tread down my own paths just to understand more about it. I'm self motivated to do more than the baseline, and even though that is more work, I think it's much more satisfying.
* Life-view: summarize what you value in life; what matters to you? I value happiness, self progression and passion. I think that if I can always feel like I'm passionate about something, I'm always going to find ways to progress and make myself better and that ultimately makes me happy. I feel like life isn't lived to the fullest if you're not happy.
* Where do your views on work and life complement each other? I think that between work and life you should find something that makes you happy. Let's say you have a job you're not particularly fond of. You should find a hobby or something outside of that that does make you happy. When I was dissatisfied with my job, I found snowboarding. And then I just used my job as a means to be able to go snowboarding everywhere and support that hobby. So, then work became less tolling because I had something to look forward to. Not everyone can find a job that is satisfying and makes them happy. Which is why I think it's important you have those other factors in your life that do make you happy.
* Where do they clash?
It clashes when you feel like you don't have time for both. Sometimes work gets in the way of what you want to do. And that always sucks. It also sucks when you feel like you have to give up life when you have to work all the time. You just have to figure out that perfect balance that works for you.
* Does one drive the other? How?
Like I said in one of my previous example. Sometimes you just have to think about things differently. You have a crappy job, but it is necessary in order for you to achieve this level of life that makes you happy. Just like how life can motivate you to work, work could help you drive your life. I really enjoy gaming. And what really drive me about coding is learning this foundation to one day be able to create something cool like that just as a hobby.
