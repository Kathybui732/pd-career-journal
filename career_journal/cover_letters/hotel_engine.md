John Siladie
VP of Engineering

Dear John,

I had the pleasure of shadowing one of your employees, Jimmy Truong, recently and was excited to see that your application strives to make it easier to book hotels for businesses. As a previous business owner and now a junior software engineer, being able to combine it was exciting to learn about the software your team is working on and the challenges they encounter.

I was excited to see that your team operates with Ruby on Rails. Being able to spot areas that I understood and knew how to approach and areas I could do a little more research in was very valuable. Your team's emphasis on testing to drive your code development was admirable and reenforced all the testing I've learned to do in the past 7 months. All of the projects I have worked on have utilized either RSpec or Minitest to drive the development.

In addition to utilizing testing, I was consistently exposed to working in a fast-paced, deadline driven, collaborative environment. However, I learned to not let pressure and deadlines take away from the quality of the code. I've picked up many skill with regards to best practices in security, optimization for user interactions, and overall accessibility. All skills that I believe with make me an ideal candidate for your company.

Sincerely,

Kathy Bui
Back-end Software Developer
