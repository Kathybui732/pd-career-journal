### Mod 2 Week 1: Creating Your Vision, Part I <a name="week-1"></a>
1. Start Where You Are (Empathize with the user -- *you*):
* Health: how you answer “how are you”; intersection of physical, mental, and emotional health
    * How would you rate your overall health on a scale of 1-5?
        * I would say that my health is at a 5 at the moment, both mentally and physically.
    * How do you currently make time for activities associated with your health?
        * Taking breaks, doing the things I like, exercising, going on walks, playing with my pets are all things I currently do to keep my self health care.
    * What is a small change you could make here to readjust your health ratings?
        * I have been trying really hard to actually take breaks when we have time for POMs, because I am guilty of just turning off my camera and just sitting there and browsing the internet instead of getting up and walking around during breaks.
* Work: what you do
    * Make a short list of all the ways you work right now
        * Setting aside a window of time to work on something. Focusing solely on that without any distractions. Trying to understand why I should be doing the things that I do. This allows me to better understand how to do it in a way.
    * How much value do each of those things bring to your life? How are those activities purposeful for you?
        * They all add tiny bits of joy to my life. I feel like being able to find relief or happiness in the small things is very important because there are a lot of little things that could also stress you out and by balancing those out with small positive things makes it so that when bigger, more stressful events come up, they won't all casacade together and make things worse.
* Play: what brings you joy? Think about joy just for the pure sake of doing it; everyone benefits from this kind of play
    * What activities do you do that bring you joy throughout an average week?
        * During the winter I love to go snowboarding/skiing, I love winter sports, so, just by being able to look forward to doing those things over the weekend makes me push through the week better. I don't let the stresses of the week get to me as easily. I find joy in my morning coffee, so, that always helps with calming the negativities of waking up in the morning. I like playing games and playing with my pets.
    * In what ways could you make a small change to bring more joy into your life?
        * I think the biggest things you can do is to remind yourself to focus on the positive things. I personally find it really stressful to have to cook everyday, so, I started meal prepping on sundays, so throughout the week when I'm in class, I don't have to worry about food. It's jsut small preventative things that are helpul and reduce the stress which in turn brings more joy to my life.
* Love: sense of connection; who are the people who matter in your life and how is love flowing to and from you and them?
    * How does love currently show up in your life?
        * The support from those around me has been the biggest representation of love in my life. Just those around me being patient and considerate of what I'm going through right now has been very appreciated.
    * How do you show love to others right now?
        * Just by making time for them and making sure that they know that I do care for them.
    * What adjustments would you like to make in this area?
        * By showing them the same support that they have been showing me.
* Looking back at the 4 areas, do any problems emerge that you want to begin designing solutions for?
    * I think that self care vs caring for those around me has been a problem lately. I just feel like I don't have any time to get work done and to focus on myself so how am I supposed to focus on others, too?

2. Define your needs, problem, and insights:
* Based on what you wrote about above and your group conversation, what problems have you identified that you'd like to design solutions for?
    * I think being able to care for others is a problem that I am currently struggling with. But, I keep telling yself that this is just temporary and that thigns will return back to normal once this bootcamp is over.
* What do you already about what you want for your career? What do you still need to find out?
    * I know that I want to do something in tech, but what that entails is still blurry to me.
* Who or what do you want to grow into by the end of the Turing program?
    * I want to become someone who is capable of not only preforming the work, but capable of evolving and advancing the work I am going to be ealing with. This includes the environment and the culture of that work.

3. Ideate -- challenge assumptions:
* When you discussed software developers with your small group on Monday, what assumptions came up about what software developers actually do?
    * They create programs and work a lot with programing languages, but there is a lot more that you can do in the field besides purely creating software.
* What steps could you take to challenge those assumptions and find more facts to answer the question of what developers do?
    * google, asked mentors, asked instructors.
* In addition to what a typical software developer life could look like, what do you want yours to include?
    * you cuold be an instructor in software development. YOu could be trying to create diversity in software. You could be a consultant that knows the code of a softward, but are in charge or selling/being knowledgeable about the software.

4. Prototype -- start creating solutions:
* What is the basic threshold that your new career must meet after Turing?
    * I would like a good paying job that is in Denver. Any job really is my basic threshold.
* What would you hope WILL NOT happen in your future after Turing?
    * I would like to be in a position that values diversity, advancement and empathy.
* What is your absolute, no-holds-barred, ideal dream for your future after Turing?
    * I would like work with A.I., programming A.I.'s

5. Test –- solutions:
* Based on this week of reflections, write out your vision statement for your career:
    * My vision statement for my career as of right now is still the same.  My mission in life is to be able to do something that feels fullfilling. I want to be able to feel inspired, passionate and forever curious every day of my life. Whether that is fullfilled by a career or a hobby doesn't matter to me. I want my mind as well as my body to feel happy. I want to feel comfortable and proud of the skin that I wear. I want to be able to create something that the world can use. I want to be able to challenge any notion that a woman of color can't be competitive in a field that predominantly filled with white males. I would like to one day be apart of creating a game or a mod that someone can use for a game. I want to be able to bring some good into the world.
