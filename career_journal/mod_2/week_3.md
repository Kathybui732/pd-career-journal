### Mod 2 Week 3: Job Search Strategies
Reflect on how you’ve spent your time so far at Turing to gauge your engagement and energy:

When have you been excited, focused, and enjoyed your work?
I have been enjoying it when it’s something that interests me and when I find people around me who are just as interested as I am. Being able to talk to them makes things more fun.
When have you felt bored, restless, or unhappy?
I feel unhappy when I feel like I don’t understand something and the people around me are. It’s hard when you feel like you’re struggling and you’re comparing yourself to those around you.
When do you feel energized in your work?
I feel most energized when I get a good nights rest and I accomplished the goals I wanted to for the day.
When is your energy drained?
I feel most drained when things don’t go according to my expectations.
Setting up habits and routines to make time for the job search this module:
Block out time on your calendar this week to work on your job search. When will you make this happen? How will you hold yourself accountable to this? What activities will you focus on during this time this week? What outcomes do you hope to reach by the end of this week because of these activities?
I think I will dedicate several hours this weekend on Saturday toward looking into jobs. I need to update my resume and LinkedIn. Hopefully I’ll have those and a cover letter ready for by the end of this.
Applying wayfinding to using job search resources
Go through the resources listed here and explore 2-3 tools. List what you looked at here:
Apply wayfinding: of what you looked at, what did you discover that aligns with your vision? If it didn't align with your vision, what will you try next?
Based on what I read, I think that I am interested in a startup type of company or a company that hasn’t made it globally. Because there was an article that said that once a company makes it globally, they shift their attention to operations and away from innovation and that innovation is what draws me in the most.
Find a job posting that aligns with your vision. What's the posting? How does it align with what you're looking for? Add it to your Huntr.

A position like this would be my ideal post Turing position.
What next steps will you take to explore that opportunity and find contacts? Add that information to your Huntr card.
There’s a contact us option. Probably just start asking questions about them in preparation for the future. Or try to make a connection there
