5. Write a refined vision statement here (what new things have you discovered this week to incorporate into your vision statement?): My mission in life is to be able to do something that feels fullfilling. I want to be able to feel inspired, passionate and forever curious every day of my life. Whether that is fullfilled by a career or a hobby doesn't matter to me. I want my mind as well as my body to feel happy. I want to feel comfortable and proud of the skin that I wear. I want to be able to create something that the world can use. I want to be able to challenge any notion that a woman of color can't be competitive in a field that predominantly filled with white males. I would like to one day be apart of creating a game or a mod that someone can use for a game. I want to be able to bring some good into the world and do something that will advance the human society.
