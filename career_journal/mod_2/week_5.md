### Mod 2 Week 5: Professional Storytelling & Branding <a name="week-5"></a>
1. Write a draft of your professional story here as 1-2 paragraphs. Focus on answering the questions *who are you, why are you here,* and *what's next?* Consider how to talk about your motives and values, the turning points that led to your career change, and what you envision for yourself going forward.

2. Update your LinkedIn profile with the following: updated photo/headshot, headline, summary statement using your story, and Turing added to your experience and education sections. Include a link to your profile here in the journal. Remember the guidelines and tips from the [lesson here](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum-site/blob/master/module_two/professional_storytelling_branding.md). https://www.linkedin.com/in/kathy-bui-87a27a1ab/

3. What other steps will you take this week to update your branding or practice your story? I think this week I'm going to focus on figuring out what I really want to do. I am going to reach out to more people and try to gain some direction with where I want to take my turing career. I reached out to my mentor who gave me a few other people I could reach out and talk to.

## Intermission Reflections
1. Please list the top 3-5 industries and companies you'll pursue in your job search as of right now.
  - Gaming
  - VR/AR
  - Healthcare

2. Why did you pick the industries/companies that you listed above? How do they relate to the values and goals you have for yourself in your job search?
  - The gaming industry reflects something I've always had a hobby in, it fills me with intrinsic interest and curiosity, so, it is a field that I would love to work in.
  - VR/AR has always been something that I have always been interested in, but too scared to approach because I have such a surface level understanding of it. I have seen what they can do to benefit society in their research as it relates to healthcare, and I would love to be in a field like that. I would be nice to combine an industry that inspires me and an industry that has been my foundation for the last few years.
  - Healthcare is my safe industry. It has been an industry I've seen many sides of and could confortably adapt to from the programming scope. I've always wanted to help people and will always want to, so, this field is something I may always come back it.

3. How does your LinkedIn currently reflect your goals and industry interests? What changes will you need to make to your LinkedIn to better reflect these?
  - I think I need to clean up my linkedin so that it no longer highlights my strong suits from my past career and move forward towards highlighting the career I want to move toward. It is just hard trying to highlight something I don't feel like I'm 100% apart of yet. I need to add how my past experience will make me a great software developer. I need to change my mission statements and goals to reflect my new career path as well.
