## Who are you, why are you here, and what's next?

My name is Kathy. I have a background in healthcare and social services. I went to school to pursue a career in the medical field, however things just didn't go as planned. I've always wanted to help people. That was always the end goal of what I wanted to do. Throughout high school and college, for about 7 years, I worked at the Denver Human Services and although I knew that wasn't something I wanted to do forever, it was something I was good at and I was able to help people. I ended up hopping on an initiative Denver had to help its elders by providing them with the services they needed while maintaining as much of their independence as possible. I never wanted to pursue a career in business, but there I was managing staff, handling payrolls and developing policies. After dedicating the last 5 years of my life toward what I thought was helping people, I realized that I wasn't feeling fulfilled anymore. I have since evolved from this notion that I really want to help people. Instead of just wanting to help people, I want to be able to help advance society. I want to be able to create something that people can use that will better their lives. That is why I am here. I have always been interested in technology, and just recently found the guts to pursue it. I want to take what I learn at Turing and create a software that will benefit society.
